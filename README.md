# Naruto Bros
A fully functional game in Python using the Pygame Library. 
Features:
Ability to Play as two diffrent charachters: Naruto (Has his own special attack, sprite, and attack sound)
                                             Sasuke (Has his own special attack, sprite, and attack sound)
                                             This is dictated by RNG.
Diffrent BackGrounds that change as the level changes.
Pause Menu
Ability to mute in Game Music
Difficulty changes as level changes.
Diffrent Color Changing Blocks/Squares.



In the future, I will be adding a screenshot ability within the game, and hope to do some minor changes.

Here is the main menu before somebody actually begins the game :)
